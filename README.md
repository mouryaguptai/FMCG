# Spend and Price Forecasting for FMCG companies

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing predictive pricing and spending forecasts for private companies, particularly in the FMCG sector, with a specific emphasis on resin and paper materials. Through a comparative analysis of statistical and machine learning models, the goal is to optimize spending forecasts over the next 12 months, providing insights that aid in purchasing, negotiation, and budgeting strategies.
